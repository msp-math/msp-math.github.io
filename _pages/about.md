I am an applied math major at UCLA, aiming to graduate with a M.S. in mathematics. I was born in Seoul, Korea, and lived in Fullerton, California since 2016. I am interested in Data Science, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Atmospheric Modeling, Financial Modeling, and Differential Equations.  

UCLA 응용수학 전공, 석사로 졸업 희망. 한국 서울에서 태어나서 2016부터 캘리포니아 풀러튼에서 거주 중. 관심분야는 데이터 과학, 전산유체역학, 대기 모델링, 금융 모델링과 미분방정식입니다.
